# Baseball Score Card

My custom baseball score cards built using LaTeX.

I've been scoring baseball games for many years but I've never found the perfect scorecard for me, so I decided to finally develop my own.  The custom scorecard combines the best aspects of the scorecards I've used throughout the years but is designed around how I personally score a game.

The main scorecard can be found in `scorecardCombinedFlipped.pdf` (with LaTeX source in `scorecardCombinedFlipped.tex`

Some of my idiosynchracies: 
 * The balls/strikes are a bit larger boxes than usual because I score swinging/looking/foul (slash/backslash/X) strikes as well as extra fouls (up to 4 in the extra box)
 * Only 9 batting slots with only 1 substitution (but with extra vertical space for more if necessary; this is sufficient with the NL likely adopting the DH in 2022)
 * Only 11 innings (sufficient for 98%+ of all MLB games)
 * Full infield to indicate splay/shift notes
 * Lower left: room for RBI notes (w/o cluttered explicit RBI text)
 * No per-batter summary stat columns (unnecessary as you can reconstruct it from the row and nonsensical IMHO when you have substantial substitutions)
 * Slots for left/right designations
 * 2nd page (home grid) is flipped for 1-page printing (and easy vertical flipping back and forth)
 * 8 relief pitcher rows, extra large row for starter (for notes), only essential stats included (no HBP nonsense)
 * Substantial note section
